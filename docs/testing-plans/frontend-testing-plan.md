# Frontend Testing Plan

## Test Strategy

Use a mix of:

- Component tests for reusable UI and renderers.
- Integration tests for API-connected flows.
- End-to-end tests for core learner/admin journeys.
- Manual accessibility and responsive checks.

## Current Implementation Status

**TypeScript, Lint, Build:** ✅ All passing
**E2E Tests:** ⚠️ Specs updated; browser execution still needs a normal local/CI environment

## P0 Automated Tests

Before browser-level tests, keep `pnpm typecheck` green. ✅ All passing.

### Auth

- Logged-out user visiting `/dashboard` redirects to `/login`. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Logged-out user visiting `/admin` redirects to `/login`. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Logged-in user visiting `/login` redirects to `/dashboard`. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Login errors display correctly. ⚠️ E2E needed

**Current Status:** E2E tests exist (`tests/e2e/auth-guard.spec.ts`, `tests/e2e/login.spec.ts`), need environment.

### Profile

- Profile form renders current values. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Required validation works. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Successful save shows confirmation. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Failed save preserves input and shows error. ⚠️ E2E needed

### Resources

- Resource list loads. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Filters update results. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Empty search shows empty state. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Resource detail renders body/examples/tags. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Save/unsave action updates UI. ⚠️ E2E needed

### Practice

- Practice list loads. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Objective question renderer works for key question types. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Answer submission displays result. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Correct/incorrect states render. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Explanations render. ⚠️ E2E needed

### Mock Test

- Mock test list loads. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Start test creates/opens attempt. ✅ Covered by updated launch-gate specs
- Draft answer state is preserved during active attempt. ✅ Verified via P0
- Full-mock future-section writes are blocked on the backend. ✅ Verified via P0
- Late timed submissions are rejected with `TIME_EXPIRED`. ✅ Verified via P0
- Section submit shows loading and result/status. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Final score page hides overall score if incomplete. ✅ Verified via P0
- Final score page shows score only when backend returns complete prediction. ✅ Verified via P0
- Listening transcripts stay hidden during active attempts. ⚠️ Browser/E2E still needed
- Mock-test credit balance and insufficient-credit states render clearly. ⚠️ E2E needed

### Evaluation

- Queued/processing statuses render. ⚠️ E2E needed

- Speaking feedback renders transcript/pronunciation unavailable message when applicable. ✅ Verified via P0

### Admin

- Admin can view resource list. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Resource form validates required fields. ⚠️ E2E needed

## Manual E2E Scenarios

### Completed Scenarios
- Landing page (`tests/e2e/landing.spec.ts`) ✅ Exists
- Login page (`tests/e2e/login.spec.ts`) ✅ Exists
- Auth guard (`tests/e2e/auth-guard.spec.ts`) ✅ Exists

### Pending Scenarios (Need Environment)
1. Register → profile setup → dashboard.
2. Login → browse resources → save resource.
3. Complete vocabulary/grammar practice.
4. Complete reading/listening practice.
5. Start mock test → submit Listening/Reading without skipping future sections.
6. Submit Writing → wait for feedback.
7. Submit Speaking text → wait for feedback.
8. Submit Speaking audio/upload if supported and confirm text fallback when recording is unavailable.
9. View final predicted score after all modules complete.
10. Admin opens Strapi resource/mock-test authoring from IELTS++ admin.
11. Learner confirms published Strapi resource/test appears when Strapi API token is configured.

## Accessibility Manual Checks

- Tab through auth forms.
- Tab through resource filters.
- Complete practice with keyboard.
- Navigate mock test sections with keyboard.
- Submit writing with keyboard.
- Start/stop speaking recording with keyboard if available.
- Confirm focus states are visible.
- Confirm color contrast is acceptable.
- Confirm status badges have text labels.

**Current Status:** Manual testing not yet performed.

## Responsive Manual Checks

Screen sizes:

- Mobile narrow.
- Mobile wide.
- Tablet.
- Laptop.
- Desktop.

Check:

- Landing page.
- Auth pages.
- Dashboard.
- Resource list/detail.
- Practice attempt.
- Reading passage layout.
- Writing textarea.
- Speaking controls.
- Score page.
- Admin resource list/form.

**Current Status:** Manual testing not yet performed.

## Regression Risks To Test Frequently

- Answer keys accidentally appearing in learner data. ✅ Verified (P0)
- Final score appearing before all modules complete. ✅ Verified (P0)
- Draft answers lost on navigation. ✅ Verified (P0)
- Timer resetting on refresh during a timed section. ✅ Server state added, browser verification still needed
- Future-section writes/submissions succeeding through direct API calls. ✅ Verified (P0)
- Late section submissions being accepted after the deadline. ✅ Verified (P0)
- Audio upload failure with unclear error. ⚠️ E2E needed
- Evaluation polling running forever. ⚠️ E2E needed
